<p>RhythmInReach is an educational game designed to improve the rhythm reading skills of students.  Developed by professional music educators, it can be used as a great tool by teachers to reinforce a musical curriculum.</p>
<p>RhythmInReach is unlike other “follow the beat” music games available today:</p>
<ul>
<li>we have no audio playback of rhythms in order to eliminate mimicking or rote learning</li>
<li>we have no arrows or visual cues on when to play notes which discourage students from note reading</li>
<li>we track both the "attack" and the "release" of the note, teaching students how to sustain notes for their full values, perfect for most all major instruments and voice</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to encourage students to develop their music reading abilities through time tested traditional means.  RhythmInReach also uses an audible and visual metronome to assist students in developing their internal beat.
